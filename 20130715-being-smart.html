	<p><font size="+3"><b><u>HOW TO BE SMART!</u></b></font size="+3"></p>

	<p>Alright, I lied in my title – I can’t <i>make</i> someone smart, because A) smartness is a matter of opinion, and B) it’s like trying to make someone with 
arachnophobia look at a spider. HOWEVER, I <i>can</i> tell you some good habits you can develop, so that you will get the same results a “smart person” gets.</p>

    	<p>&#183; 1.	Assess your situation (I’ve always wanted to say that!). How are you right now? Are you a straight-A student, but lousy with people? Are you a Bs 
and Cs kinda person, who is trying to make the parents happy? Figure it out, honestly, and don’t let the results, whether it’s negative or positive, get into your head.
    	<p>&#183; 2.	Clean. Besides finding that long-lost sock / homework assignment / pizza slice, having a nice, neat room, desk and locker will help you focus 
and seem mature, and “together.” Stay after school for a few minutes to clear out your desk and locker, and spend the weekend cleaning your room.  See how <i>I</i>  
clean my room! </p>

	<p>Also clean up your act. If you’re a bully, STOP IT (especially seeing as how <i>everyone</i> now knows bullies almost always are bullied cowards themselves). 
If you are so shy you freeze up when someone says “Hi”, say “Hi” back – the worst that could happen is that people will wonder when you got so talkative!! 
If you make bad choices, like drugs, underage drinking and overdrinking, see someone to help you start making good ones, because no one can be smart with junk pumping 
through their systems.</p>

	<p>Clean your appearance. For some totally unfair reason, nerds and geeks are stereotyped as ugly, anti-social, overachieving class pets. Challenge that 
stereotype. Take care of your appearance, have a bath once or twice a day, make sure your clothes fit properly, are clean and look good on you, and exercise. Not only 
will it keep you from being fat and unhealthy, exercise helps circulate blood to your brain (which is good).</p> 


    	<p>&#183; 3.	Actually do your homework well. As Tamaki said in <i>Bamboo Blade</i>, “Something worth doing, is worth doing well.” It’ll make people happy with 
you, make you more knowledgeable, and get you into a good college. Win-win!</p>


    	<p>&#183; 4.	Read. EVERYTHING. Even if you prefer dragons over plant cells or an athlete’s biography over a scientists, it’ll help. Plus, it can actually be 
interesting!</p>

<p>&#183; 5.	Exercise that mush between your ears. In other words, do things like Rubik cubes, word puzzles, chess, etc.  Your brain needs exercise just like your 
body does, and, instead of weights, exercise your brain with word puzzles and mind games. Get a few friends to join you and start some competitions! </p>

<p>Make sure your new clothes are things you <i>love</i>, even if they are a mite unconventional, make sure they fit properly (which means no shirts that you could stuff a 
walrus in) and make sure they don’t give people the wrong impression, i.e. clothes that could pass for underwear, giant hoodies with something that looks like 
blood on them, etc.<img src="smile.jpg" alt="logo" height="17.5" width="18"></p>

<p>&#183; 6.	THINK. I cann<i>ot</i> stress how important thinking is. It’ll keep you from doing dumb things like having a temper tantrum or jumping off a bridge, and 
the ability to think things through is a rare quality in a person.</p>

<p>So that’s it, folks: how to give Albert Einstein a run for his money.<img src="smile.jpg" alt="logo" height="17.5" width="18"> Just remember: there are different kinds 
of smart, and, whether that’s people smart or book smart, they are all important. Hope to see you soon at an Ivy League college! Ciao for now, peeps!
