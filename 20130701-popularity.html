	<p><b>1st July, 2013</b></p>
	<p><font size="+3"><b><u>I WANT TO BE POPULAR!</u></b></font size="+3"></p>

	<p>Hey, hey, hey!! Well, fellow internet users, <i>I’m back</i>! And here is the problem for this post: popularity. Whether it’s popularity in school, work, whatever, 
how to be popular is pretty much the same all around, with only a few tweaks. So now I will show you how to be at least semi-popular, even if you are the geek of the 
office, freak of the school, or the green-skinned witch. </p>

    	<p>&#183; 1.	First, take a good, long look in the mirror. Do you slouch worse than the Hunchback of Notre Dame? Do you (ahem) smell less-then-pleasant? Remember, 
don’t worry about whether you are short or skinny or enjoy wearing eco-friendly shirts. Just think about things like posture, aroma, whether or not you wear the same shirt 
for days on end, and whether or not you constantly have a massive scowl on your face. <i>Those</i> are the things that scare potential friends away – not your clothes, and 
not your face.
    	<p>&#183; 2.	Next, FIX THOSE THINGS!! It’s not going to happen overnight, though – bad habits are hard to break, and all the things I just mentioned are bad habits. </p>

    	<p>&#183; 3.	Take a good long look at how you treat others. Are you mean to the people you love? Do you constantly swear? Or do you let people walk all over you, 
and let them tell you what to do? </p>

<p>Well, DON’T. The people you love aren’t going to be here one day, and if all you can remember then is how awful you were, that’s not good, is it? And swearing constantly 
is neither classy nor necessary.  There are more words in whatever language you use besides f*** and s***.</p> 

<p>And if you let people walk all over you, you are not doing yourself justice. <i>You</i> are the only you there will ever be, and if you spend your life never doing anything 
unless someone else tells you to, you will never be truly happy. <i>You</i> have opinions: express them! If you don’t agree, say so. (Just make sure that you disagree politely, 
because you don’t want to become the person who told you what to do and think, right?)</p>


    	<p>&#183; 4.	Fourthly (is that even a word?), do what you love and WANT to do. Whether it’s drawing anime, praying to Allah, cooking, whatever – it’ll make 
<i>you</i> HAPPY, give you confidence, and if people see you doing what you love, people who like the same things you do will naturally gravitate towards you. But, make 
sure that thing you want to do isn’t hurting people, animals, going to jail, etc. That isn’t true happiness (unless you are a psycho, which I really hope you’re not) and 
will just mess with your life.</p>

<p>&#183; 5.	After this, is my all-time favorite part: shopping!! If you love your wardrobe, just skip this step. However, if you don’t, first you gotta clean out your 
closet. All those Forever 21 and Gap clothes you’ve secretly hated but got because it’s “cool”? Donate them to someone who might appreciate them. That shirt you have with 
more holes then the Moon has craters? <i>Toss</i>. And, after you do all of that, s-h-o-p!! Here is what’s great about this whole New-You thing: if you, before reading my 
fabulous blog, were sulky, passive-aggressive and a potential loony, but are now (hopefully) awesome, classy, kind and polite, your parents/boss/professor will probably 
buy all your new clothes for you! </p>

<p>Make sure your new clothes are things you <i>love</i>, even if they are a mite unconventional, make sure they fit properly (which means no shirts that you could stuff a 
walrus in) and make sure they don’t give people the wrong impression, i.e. clothes that could pass for underwear, giant hoodies with something that looks like 
blood on them, etc.</p>

<p>&#183; 6.	Finally, after you have fixed your bad habits, changed your attitude for the better, decided to join new clubs and meet new people, and gotten a new 
wardrobe that reflects who you are, remember this final thing: contrary to the title of this post, the main thing isn’t to become the most popular girl or guy in the 
whole entire universe. The main thing is to become awesome – after all look at all those superheroes who actually save the world every night, but by day they are the 
quiet, unassuming, geeks and freaks of the world. Go figure, right?</p>

<p>And now for some quick tips:</p>

    	<p>&#183; Try your transformation in the summer:  for one thing, it’s hard to change when you’ve still got school and job stuff to worry about, 
and, also, it’ll knock the socks off of people when you go back to school/work.</p>
    	<p>&#183; Don’t be shy around new people: they aren’t going to bite, and they might even become your friend! I met most of my friends by just 
going up and saying, “Hey!”</p>
    	<p>&#183; Try to be nice to people whenever possible: even to the haters and mean people in the world. It is actually v. classy and smart to 
keep your cool around someone you want to throttle; it makes you look scarier and in-charge. Also, just remember what Socrates once said, “Be kind, for 
everyone you meet is fighting a hard battle.”</p>

    	<p>So, good luck, newly-popular folks! May this post be of some help to you, and I will see y'all in two weeks! <img src="smile.jpg" alt="logo" height="17.5" width="18"></p>
