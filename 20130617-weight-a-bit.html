	<p><font size="+3"><b><u>WEIGHT A BIT!</u></b></font size="+3"></p>

	<p>If you are not overweight, DO NOT READ THIS!! I refuse to help someone become anorexic or bulimic. </p>

	<p>For all of you overweight people, though, losing weight has a bunch of benefits. You will live longer, happier and healthier &#8211; and, really, who wouldn&#8217;t want that?</p>

  	<p>So here are some tips on how to lose weight safely (which means no starving yourself two days a week and stuffing yourself with M&amp;Ms and Cheetos the other five).</p>

    	<p>&#183; Figure out your target weight. You can find this out easily, either through your doctor or the internet. Next, you need to figure out how many calories you should have each day.
The average female needs about 2,000 calories, while the average male needs about 2,500 calories. However, this isn&#8217;t factoring in height, age and lifestyle, so, again &#8211; consult your doctor or professional websites!</p>

    	<p>&#183; Next, have a party. No seriously &#8211; if you are like me, and you have a bunch of junk food and soda just lying around the house, you aren&#8217;t going to go very far with this whole diet plan before you cave in.
So, have a party and make sure only your guests eat the unhealthy food and drink. If partying isn&#8217;t really your style, though, donate to the homeless.</p>

    	<p>&#183; Now, if you are all set, get out your old running shoes, swimsuit, etc. Eating less unhealthy stuff is all well and good, but if you actually want to be <i>healthy </i>you are going to need to exercise, too.
Luckily, exercising can mean anything from yoga to swimming to running a marathon. According to the Department of Health and Human Services, an average adult should get either 150 minutes of moderate exercise (such as jumping jacks)
or 75 minutes of vigorous exercise (such as riding a bike) a week. If you are like me, though, and you&#8217;re a teenager, ask your parents to enroll you in a fun class, like taekwondo or maybe hip-hop.
If you&#8217;re broke, try babysitting a super-hyper kid, or maybe petsitting a crazy energetic dog &#8211; not only will you earn money chasing after your charge, be it on two legs or four, you will get at least <i>some </i>exercise.
You could also try to walk or bike to more places. You won&#8217;t have to pay for gas, you&#8217;ll be helping out Mother Nature, <i>and</i> it&#8217;ll help you with your weight-loss.</p>

    	<p>&#183; Hopefully, by now, you are sticking to your HealthyMe plan. If you are thinking of caving in, though, try this trick my friend&#8217;s grandmother told her. Buy a swimsuit in the size you want to be.
Take a picture of yourself in it. If you dare, keep the picture in your bag at all times and stare at it. If, however, you are worried your friends, co-workers, or annoying little brothers are going to find it,
just stuff the swimsuit in the bag &#8211; it&#8217;ll work the same way.</p>

    	<p>&#183; So you&#8217;ve lost the weight, you are now healthy, skinny and super-hot. Now what? Well, you'll need to level off your calorie intake. That just means adding about 500 more calories to your meal plan.</p>

    	<p>Sadly, only 15-20% of people who lose weight keep off those excess pounds &#8211; most, after a few years, gain it all back and then some. That&#8217;s why this is REALLY important you guys:</p>

    	<p><font size="+2">It&#8217;s not a <i>diet</i>, it&#8217;s a <i>lifestyle change</i>.</font size="+2"></p>

	<p>And here are some quick tips:</p>

    	<p>1. Drink a lot of water &#8211; it will help make your skin awesome and is better than soda or juice any day. Your body needs water &#8211; think of it like the oil in your car,
because without the oil your car is useless, right?</p>

    	<p>2. Substitute fruit for dessert. Fruits are full of sugar as well, but it&#8217;s healthier than a giant ice-cream sundae. Try out my personal favorite &#8211; vanilla yogurt with honey, strawberries and blueberries. Yum!</p>

	<p>3. Only go on the scale once a month &#8211; I know it sounds weird, but that way you aren&#8217;t focusing on a number. Remember, you are doing this to become more healthy, happy and have longevity in life!</p>

	<p>Well, that&#8217;s all I have, folks! I hope this post will help some of you, and I hope that all of you have a fabulous two weeks in store for you.<img src="smile.jpg" alt="logo" height="17.5" width="18"></p>
